This is the anomaly detection through explanations (ADE)
architecture.  It compromises of two systems:
1. A system level architecture (ADE) which uses a synthesizer to
  reconcile failures amongst a set of reasonableness monitors.
2. Reasonableness monitors for each subsystem.

** Commonsense


Run conceptNet tests with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
python3 system_tests/test_conceptnet.py -m unittest
#+END_SRC

** Reasonableness monitor
** Synthesizer
** Tasks
*** TODO Test suite
- Tests are scattered throughout the repo.  The most recent tests are
  in commonsense/tests and should probably be put somewhere else in
  the repo.
